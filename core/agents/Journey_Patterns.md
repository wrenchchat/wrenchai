# Journey Patterns

**Rationale:**

*   **Immediate Value:** Providing pre-built `Journey` agents allows users to immediately experience the framework's capabilities without needing to understand the intricacies of agent configuration. This is crucial for initial adoption and demonstrating value.
*   **Guided Learning:** The pre-built agents serve as examples and templates, helping users understand how agents are structured, how they interact with tools, and how playbooks are defined. This facilitates learning and makes it easier for users to eventually create their own agents.
*   **Controlled Complexity:** Starting with a limited set of agents allows you to focus on building a robust core framework (Super, Inspector, core tools, Bayesian reasoning, cost tracking) before tackling the complexities of user-defined agents.
*   **Iterative Development:** This approach aligns with agile development principles. You can release a functional framework with basic capabilities and then iteratively add features (like user-defined agents) based on user feedback and your own priorities.
*   **Security Considerations:** Allowing users to define their own agents, especially if it involves code execution, introduces significant security risks. Starting with a controlled set of agents allows you to implement robust security measures before opening up the system to user-defined code.

**Implementation Considerations:**

1.  **Initial Set of Journey Agents:**
    *   **Variety:** Include a diverse set of pre-built `Journey` agents that cover common use cases and demonstrate the range of capabilities of your framework. Based on your previous examples, this could include:
        *   `WebResearcher`: Performs web searches and summarizes information.
        *   `CodeGenerator`: Generates code (e.g., Python, JavaScript, React components).
        *   `DataAnalyzer`: Processes and analyzes data.
        *   `DocumentRedactor`: Redacts sensitive information from documents.
        *   `ContentCreator`: Generates different types of content (e.g., documentation, articles).
    *   **Well-Documented:** Provide clear documentation for each pre-built agent, including its purpose, the tools it uses, the playbook it follows, and examples of how to use it.
    *   **YAML-Defined:** Define each pre-built agent using the YAML configuration format you've established. This ensures consistency and makes it easier to manage and modify the agents.

2.  **Mechanism for User-Defined Agents (Future Feature):**
    *   **YAML-Based Definition:** The most natural approach is to allow users to define their own agents using the same YAML format as the pre-built agents. This provides a consistent and familiar interface.
    *   **UI for Agent Creation:** Provide a user-friendly interface (within your Streamlit app, and later your React app) for creating, editing, and managing user-defined agents. This could involve:
        *   A form-based interface for filling in the YAML fields (name, description, LLM, tools, playbook).
        *   A code editor (with syntax highlighting) for directly editing the YAML configuration.
        *   A visual workflow editor (more advanced) for defining playbooks graphically.
    *   **Playbook Management:** Users will need a way to create and manage their own playbooks. This could involve:
        *   A library of pre-built playbook steps that users can combine.
        *   A mechanism for defining custom playbook steps (potentially involving code generation, but with strict security controls).
    *   **Tool Selection:** Provide a curated list of available tools that users can choose from when configuring their agents. This helps ensure that users don't accidentally try to use tools that are not supported or that pose security risks.
    *   **Validation:** Implement robust validation of user-defined agent configurations to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities. This should include:
        *   YAML schema validation.
        *   Checking for valid LLM and tool selections.
        *   Verifying that the specified playbook exists and is valid.
        *   Sandboxing any user-provided code (absolutely crucial).
    *   **Security:** This is the *most critical* aspect of user-defined agents. Implement strict security measures to prevent malicious code execution and data breaches. This should include:
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run user-provided code in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., Docker containers, WebAssembly, or a cloud-based code execution service with strict resource limits).
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Carefully sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant user-defined agents only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all actions performed by user-defined agents.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which user-defined agents can consume resources (to prevent denial-of-service attacks).
    *   **Testing:** Provide a mechanism for users to test their custom agents in a safe environment before deploying them.
    *   **Version Control (Optional):** Consider implementing version control for user-defined agents and playbooks, allowing users to revert to previous versions if necessary.
    * **User Authentication and Authorization (Future):** If you plan to allow multiple users to create and share agents, you'll need a robust authentication and authorization system.

3.  **Transition from Pre-built to User-Defined:**

    *   **Gradual Rollout:** Don't enable user-defined agents until you have a solid security and validation framework in place.
    *   **Clear Communication:** Clearly communicate to users the risks and limitations of user-defined agents.
    *   **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on how to create, configure, and secure user-defined agents.

By starting with a set of well-defined, pre-built `Journey` agents and later adding support for user-defined agents in a controlled and secure manner, you can create a powerful and flexible agentic framework that caters to both novice and advanced users. This approach prioritizes usability, security, and iterative development.
