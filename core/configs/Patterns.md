# LLM Overview

Claude 3.5 Sonnet:

Strengths: Excellent at code generation (especially front-end like React), strong NLP capabilities (summarization, redaction, rewriting), good at structured content generation (Markdown), handles large-scale documents well.

Weaknesses: Less strong on deep theoretical explanations compared to Gemini.

Tools: Can utilize all standard tools, but particularly excels with code generation/execution, RAG (for documentation), and data analysis tools.

Gemini 2.0 Flash (I assume you mean 1.5 Flash, as 2.0 is not a current model):

Strengths: Multimodal reasoning, strong at understanding complex concepts and relationships, provides structured explanations and diagrams, transparent reasoning process.

Weaknesses: Potentially overkill for simple tasks; may be more expensive than DeepSeek.

Tools: Can use all standard tools, excels with multimodal input/output, web search, RAG, and specialized LLMs for complex reasoning.

DeepSeek Coder V1 (I will use DeepSeek Coder because it is relevant to all tasks.)

Strengths: Cost-effective, highly scalable, efficient for processing and categorizing large amounts of data (text, code, schemas), good for repetitive tasks.

Weaknesses: Less capable of deep reasoning or complex logic compared to Claude and Gemini.

Tools: Primarily benefits from code generation/execution, data analysis tools, and memory (for caching).

This detailed breakdown demonstrates how to combine LLMs, roles, tools, and playbooks to create effective agent patterns for a variety of tasks. The key is to leverage the strengths of each LLM and use the agent framework to orchestrate their interactions. Remember to focus on:

Clear Task Decomposition: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable subtasks.

Appropriate Tool Allocation: Assigning the right tools to each agent based on their capabilities.

Well-Defined Playbooks: Creating clear, step-by-step instructions for each agent.

Robust Quality Control: Using the Inspector and specialized QC LLMs to ensure high-quality results.
