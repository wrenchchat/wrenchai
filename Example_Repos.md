# Example Repos

Okay, let's find some good GitHub repositories for inspiration and best practices. I'll categorize them to cover the different aspects of your project (Bayesian reasoning, agentic systems, RAG/CAG, tools, Streamlit/Panel). It's worth noting that finding a single repo that perfectly matches *all* your criteria is unlikely, so we'll look at repos that excel in specific areas.

**1. Agentic Systems and Frameworks:**

*   **LangChain:** This is probably the *most* relevant and widely used framework for building applications with LLMs. It's not purely agentic in the sense of your specific architecture (Super, Inspector, Journey), but it provides excellent examples of:
    *   **Chains:** Sequences of LLM calls and tool usage.
    *   **Agents:** Conceptual agents that can choose tools and execute actions.
    *   **Tools:** Integrations with various tools (search, databases, etc.).
    *   **Memory:** Mechanisms for storing and retrieving information.
    *   **Callbacks:** Handling asynchronous events and streaming outputs.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
    *   **Focus:** Look at the `agents`, `chains`, and `tools` directories.  The examples are also very helpful.  LangChain uses Pydantic extensively for data validation and structuring, which is a good practice to adopt.

*   **AutoGen (Microsoft):** A framework for building multi-agent conversations.  It's closer to your architecture in terms of having multiple interacting agents.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
    *   **Focus:**  Examine how agents are defined, how they communicate, and how tasks are delegated.  AutoGen has good examples of using different LLMs and integrating with tools.

*   **CrewAI:** Another framework designed for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)
    *   **Focus:** Similar to AutoGen, look at agent definition, communication, and task delegation.  CrewAI has a strong emphasis on roles and collaboration.

*   **Haystack (Deepset):** More focused on RAG and question answering, but it has agentic components and good examples of integrating with various tools and LLMs.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
    *   **Focus:** Explore the `agents` and `nodes` directories.  Haystack has good examples of using different retrievers and generators.

*  **LlamaIndex:** Focuses on connecting LLMs to your own data and has recently been moving in the direction of agentic features.
    * **GitHub**: [https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
    * **Focus:** Check the `agent` directory.

**2. Bayesian Reasoning (Less directly agentic, more about the math):**

*   **PyMC:** A popular library for probabilistic programming in Python. It's excellent for building Bayesian models.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc)
    *   **Focus:**  Look at the examples and tutorials to understand how to implement Bayesian inference in Python. This is less about agent architecture and more about the underlying statistical methods.

*   **Stan:** A probabilistic programming language. It has interfaces for many languages including python.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan) (PyStan - Python interface)
    *   **Focus:**  Similar to PyMC, explore examples to understand how to implement Bayesian models.

*   **Edward2 (TensorFlow Probability):**  A probabilistic programming library built on TensorFlow.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/google/edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2)
    *   **Focus:** Examples of Bayesian models and inference methods using TensorFlow.

**3. RAG and CAG:**

*   The LangChain, Haystack, and LlamaIndex repositories mentioned above are also excellent resources for RAG and CAG. They have extensive examples and documentation on these topics.
*  **ChromaDB**: An AI-native open-source embedding database.
    * **GitHub:** [https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)

**4. Streamlit and Panel Applications:**

*   **Streamlit Gallery:** The official Streamlit gallery showcases various applications built with Streamlit.  This is a good place to get inspiration for UI design and functionality.
    *   **Website:** [https://streamlit.io/gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery)  (Often links to GitHub repos)

*   **Awesome Streamlit:** A curated list of awesome Streamlit resources, including example apps.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit)

*   **Panel Gallery:** Similar to the Streamlit gallery, but for Panel.
    *   **Website:** [https://panel.holoviz.org/](https://panel.holoviz.org/) (Look for examples and apps)

*   **Awesome Panel:**  A curated list of Panel resources.
    *   **GitHub:** [https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel)

**5. Tools and Integrations:**

*   The LangChain and Haystack repositories are good examples of how to integrate with various tools (e.g., search APIs, databases, etc.). They often have well-defined interfaces for creating custom tools.

**How to Use These Repositories:**

1.  **Explore the Code:** Don't just look at the READMEs; dive into the code itself.  Pay attention to how the projects are structured, how classes and functions are defined, and how different components interact.
2.  **Run the Examples:** Many of these repositories have example applications or scripts.  Run these examples to see how they work and to get a feel for the code in action.
3.  **Read the Documentation:** Good documentation is crucial.  Read the documentation for the libraries and frameworks that are relevant to your project.
4.  **Focus on Specific Areas:** Don't try to understand everything at once. Focus on the specific areas that are most relevant to your current task (e.g., agent communication, tool integration, Bayesian calculations).
5.  **Adapt, Don't Copy:**  Don't blindly copy code from these repositories.  Understand the code and adapt it to your specific needs and architecture.
6. **Look for design patterns:** Many of the above follow very similar design patterns.

By reviewing these repositories, you can gain valuable insights into how to design, implement, and structure your agentic framework. Remember to focus on the aspects that are most relevant to your project and to adapt the ideas and techniques to your specific needs. Good luck!
