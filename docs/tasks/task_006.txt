# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Pydantic Models for Playbook Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Pydantic models for playbook configuration as specified in the PRD, focusing on the Docusaurus Portfolio Playbook.
# Details:
1. Create models/playbook_config.py with the models specified in the PRD
2. Implement ThemeType enum for Docusaurus themes
3. Implement Technology enum for project technologies
4. Create the Project model for portfolio projects
5. Implement SocialLinks model for social media profiles
6. Create the DocusaurusConfig model with validation rules
7. Add example configurations and schema extras
8. Ensure all models have proper validation, type hints, and field descriptions
9. Add methods for serialization and deserialization if needed

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for model validation using valid and invalid data. Verify that validation errors are raised appropriately for invalid inputs. Test serialization and deserialization of model instances.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement base enum types and foundational models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational enum types and basic models that other components will depend on, including ThemeType, Technology, and SocialLinks models.
### Details:
1. Create models/playbook_config.py file with proper imports (pydantic, typing, etc.)
2. Implement ThemeType enum for Docusaurus themes (classic, dark, etc.)
3. Implement Technology enum for project technologies (Python, React, etc.)
4. Create the SocialLinks model for social media profiles with appropriate field validations
5. Add proper type hints, field descriptions, and validation rules to all models
6. Include docstrings explaining the purpose of each model/enum

## 2. Implement Project model and related components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the Project model for portfolio projects with all required fields, validations, and relationships to other models.
### Details:
1. Implement the Project model with fields for title, description, image, link, etc.
2. Add validation for project fields (URL format, required fields, etc.)
3. Connect the Project model with the Technology enum to categorize projects
4. Implement any helper methods needed for project data manipulation
5. Add schema extras and examples to improve documentation
6. Ensure proper field descriptions and type hints are included

## 3. Implement DocusaurusConfig model with validation and serialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the main DocusaurusConfig model that integrates all other models, with complete validation rules and serialization methods.
### Details:
1. Implement the DocusaurusConfig model that includes SocialLinks and Project models
2. Add all required configuration fields as specified in the PRD
3. Implement complex validation rules (e.g., required combinations of fields)
4. Add methods for serialization and deserialization if needed
5. Create comprehensive examples of complete configurations
6. Add schema extras for improved documentation
7. Implement any utility methods for working with the configuration
8. Ensure the model structure matches the expected Docusaurus configuration format
