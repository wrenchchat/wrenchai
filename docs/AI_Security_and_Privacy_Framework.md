This separation shows how high-level policy requirements are translated into concrete software implementations. The policy section defines what must be done, while the software section shows how it's enforced through code.

### Key aspects:
1. Policies are defined at a high level but mapped to specific software controls
2. Software implementations include error handling and logging
3. Modular design allows for policy updates without major code changes
4. Audit trails are maintained throughout
5. Security and privacy controls are integrated into core functionality
