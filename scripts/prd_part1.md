# Product Requirements Document: Wrench AI Toolbox

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Wrench AI Toolbox is a Streamlit-based application that serves as a user interface for the Wrench AI framework. It enables users to leverage the power of coordinated AI agents through configurable playbooks to solve complex problems automatically. This PRD focuses specifically on implementing a robust Streamlit interface for executing the Docusaurus Portfolio Playbook.

### 1.2 Product Overview

Wrench AI is an intelligent automation platform powered by specialized AI agents that work together to solve complex problems. The platform consists of three core components:

1. **Agents**: Specialized AI assistants with specific skills and expertise
2. **Playbooks**: Workflows that coordinate multiple agents to accomplish tasks
3. **Tools**: Capabilities that agents can use to perform actions

The Streamlit app we're building will allow users to interact with this ecosystem through a clean, intuitive interface that provides clear explanations, guided workflows, and real-time visibility into the execution process.

### 1.3 Business Goals

- Simplify the process of using the Wrench AI framework
- Enable users to create professional portfolio websites without technical expertise
- Showcase the capabilities of AI-driven automation
- Provide transparency into the agent collaboration process
- Create a foundation for future AI automation applications
